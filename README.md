# AI-Flappy-Bird
A reinforcement-learning experiment that uses the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to develop a feed-forward neural network that learns to play Flappy Bird (built using PyGame), one generation at a time, with each generation consisting of 7 birds introduced to the game environment together.
